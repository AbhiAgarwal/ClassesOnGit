#### Classes On Git

The aim of this project is to document the code, the work, and the notes people take within classes at different universities. There is an enormous amount of code and information on Github that has been produced for classes around the world. We're trying to create a repository where individuals are able to look at classes at different universities, and what they teach. We're also trying to catalog different courses at different universities that might be interesting to people.
